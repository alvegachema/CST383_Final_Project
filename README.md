## Introduction

The objective of our project is to predict the overall happiness of a country and identify certain characteristics/features of a nation which may be strongly correlated with a higher happiness score. The happiness score is determined from the World Happiness Report which collects and determines a countryâ€™s happiness and ranking based off the Gallup World Poll in which life evaluation questions are asked of a countries population. Determining a nations state of happiness and correlating factors is important as this information is used by governments, health organizations, economists, psychologists and other organizations to influence research and policy-making decisions and assess the progress of a nation.
